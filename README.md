Hello

I am Saad. After completing my two preparatory years at Morocco, I am now a proud student of ENSEEIHT, a top-ranking engineering graduate school based in Toulouse. Since I have always been passionate about science and new technologies, I am following the computer science course with the aim to work in cybersecurity.
